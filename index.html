        <h4>Dr. Christopher Ross has provided psychotherapy and supervised the psychotherapeutic work of other mental health professionals in a variety of settings including the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Youthdale Treatment Services in Toronto, and the Southdown Institute for Religious and Clergy in Aurora. Until recently Dr. Ross was Associate Professor in Psychology and Religion in the Department of Religion and Culture at Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo. </h4> <br>
        <h4> He is currently associated with Waterloo Lutheran Seminary teaching “Faiths in Psychological Perspective”, and a course entitled “Mindfulness and Psychotherapy”. A current research project investigates the ways in which sensitivity to personality differences and familiarity with a variety of meditation methods may make psychotherapy and the development of mindfulness more efficient and effective in everyday-life.</h4><br>
        <h4>He completed his doctoral training with Drs Charles and Robert Carkhuff authors of Towards Effective Counselling and Psychotherapy, the classic text in the history of psychotherapy research.</h4>

        <h3>Concerns</h3>
        <h4>Dr. Ross’ clients bring to him range from feeling anxious or being worn out, to challenges to personal and social meaning, and problems with intimacy or confidence: </h4><br>
        <h4><i>“I have found many seeking help carry more grief than they realise, while others more anger. Mindful awareness of either releases energy that then naturally flows toward what individuals really value”</i></h4><br>
        <h4>Other clients simply need support and guidance while encountering a new life-stage.</h4><br>
        <h3>Approaches</h3>
        <h4>Dr. Ross uses a variety of approaches in the psychotherapy that he offers. Barriers to relaxation, for example, are explored. Belief-systems – whether religious or secular – are examined for their potential to recover a sense of life-satisfaction, while habits producing stress or that drain energy may be gently challenged. To guide the healing process Dr. Ross may draw on his knowledge of psychological diagnoses, but more often he organises his work with clients around such existential concerns as finding meaning while dealing with loneliness, intimacy or death anxiety, or the absence of a sense of freedom and entitlement.  </h4><br>

        <h4>Dr. Ross has experience supervising the psychotherapy offered by health professionals and educators in a number of different settings, including out-patient and in-patient treatment at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, Youthdale Treatment Centres, Ontario, and the NIMH-funded Comprehensive Community Mental Health Centre in Youngstown, Ohio. Currently his clinical supervision includes those seeking registration with the newly formed Ontario College of Psychotherapists. </h4><br>
        <h3>Approaches to psychotherapy supervision</h3>
        <h4>The methods that Dr. Ross uses in supervision vary with the needs of the individual psychotherapist. Overall he uses a competency based model - pioneered by the American Psychological Association - to organise the elements of his supervision. These may vary from case management methods, helping with premature terminations, low show rates and the intersection of gender, ethnicity and class for those professionals working in clinics and treatment services, to the intricacies of technique, transference and counter-transference in individuals’ independent practices. He also advises on regulatory and ethical issues arising from the practice of psychotherapy.  </h4><br>
